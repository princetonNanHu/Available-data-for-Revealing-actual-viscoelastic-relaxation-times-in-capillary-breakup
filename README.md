# Available-data-for-Revealing-actual-viscoelastic-relaxation-times-in-capillary-breakup
This GitHub repository contains the raw experimental and simulation data, as well as the code, from the main text of the paper "Revealing Actual Viscoelastic Relaxation Times in Capillary Breakup" by Nan Hu, Jonghyun Hwang, Tachin Ruangkriengsin, and Howard A. Stone. It is provided to enable interested readers to directly access and use the data and code.

The dataset includes an Excel spreadsheet and several MATLAB code files, covering all subfigures from Figures 1 to 4 in the main text. Readers are encouraged to contact the corresponding author of the paper if they have any questions regarding the data or the code.
